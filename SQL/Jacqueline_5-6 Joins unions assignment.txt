SELECT *
FROM film
INNER JOIN film_actor
ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id;




2. Join the actor table to the film_actor table. 
SELECT *
FROM actor
INNER JOIN film_actor
ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id;




3. Try to join the actor, film_actor, and film table together (3 joins!)
SELECT *
FROM film
INNER JOIN film_actor
ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id
INNER Join actor
ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id;
